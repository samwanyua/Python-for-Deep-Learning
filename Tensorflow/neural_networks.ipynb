    "###  What is an Artificial Neural Network?  \n",
    "An **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** is a computational model inspired by **biological neural networks** in the human brain. It consists of layers of **interconnected neurons** that process information and learn patterns from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure of an ANN  \n",
    "An ANN typically consists of three main types of layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input Layer**   \n",
    "   - Takes raw input features (e.g., images, text, or numbers).  \n",
    "   - Passes them to the next layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hidden Layers**  \n",
    "   - Perform computations and extract patterns.  \n",
    "   - Each neuron applies a mathematical transformation (e.g., weighted sum + activation function).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Output Layer**  \n",
    "   - Produces the final result (e.g., classification label or predicted value).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### How an ANN Works?  \n",
    "1. **Forward Propagation:**  \n",
    "   - Inputs pass through the network layer by layer.  \n",
    "   - Neurons apply weights, biases, and activation functions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Loss Calculation:**  \n",
    "   - The network compares predictions to actual values using a **loss function** (e.g., MSE, Cross-Entropy).  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Backward Propagation (Backpropagation):**  \n",
    "   - Computes **gradients** using differentiation.  \n",
    "   - Adjusts weights via **Gradient Descent** (or other optimizers like Adam).  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Training Iteration (Epochs):**  \n",
    "   - The process repeats multiple times until the model learns effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "| Function   | Formula | Usage |\n",
    "|------------|---------|--------|\n",
    "| **Sigmoid** | \\( \\sigma(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} \\) | Outputs probability (0 to 1) |\n",
    "| **ReLU** | \\( f(x) = \\max(0, x) \\) | Handles non-linearity, prevents vanishing gradient |\n",
    "| **Softmax** | \\( \\frac{e^x}{\\sum e^x} \\) | Used for multi-class classification |\n",

    "âœ” **Learns complex patterns** automatically.  \n",
    "âœ” **Can handle large datasets** and unstructured data (e.g., images, text).  \n",
    "âœ” **Adaptable** to various domains (vision, speech, NLP).  \n",

    "###  Challenges of ANN  \n",
